# Server Reads and Writes Data

In the context of network programming and dealing with sockets, receive and send buffers play a key role in the transmission of data. Both buffers are a kind of temporary storage used during the process of transmitting data. Let's look at each of them.

`Receive Buffer`: When data arrives at a socket (for example, after a client sends data to a server), it's first placed into a receive buffer. This buffer acts like a holding area for incoming data until your application is ready to process it. Your application reads from this buffer to handle incoming data. The size of this buffer can often be adjusted depending on the application's needs and resources, balancing between memory usage and network efficiency.

`Send Buffer`: When your application wants to send data (like a response to a client), it places this data into a send buffer. The operating system then handles transmitting this data across the network. As with the receive buffer, the size of the send buffer can often be adjusted. A larger send buffer can allow your application to write more data to be sent before it needs to wait for the data to be actually transmitted over the network.

The operating system manages these buffers and the movement of data between them and the network. When your application reads data from a socket, it's actually reading from the receive buffer. When it writes data to a socket, it's writing to the send buffer.

It's also worth noting that these buffers are associated with each individual socket. So in a server handling many clients, each client connection (represented by a socket) would have its own pair of send and receive buffers.
