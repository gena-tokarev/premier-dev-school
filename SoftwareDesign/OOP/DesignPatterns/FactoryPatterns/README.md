# Factory patterns

The main difference between the Factory pattern and the Factory Method pattern is that the Factory pattern uses a single factory class to create objects, while the Factory Method pattern uses a separate factory class for each type of object. The Factory pattern provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, while the Factory Method pattern provides an interface for creating objects in a subclass.
