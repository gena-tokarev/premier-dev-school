# GRASP - General Responsibility Assignment Software Patterns

A set of principles or guidelines that help developers create flexible and reusable software designs.

1. **Creator** - The creator pattern refers to the principle that an object should be responsible for creating other objects that it requires to do its work.
2. **Information Expert** - The information expert pattern suggests that an object that has the most information about a task or responsibility should be responsible for carrying out that task.
3. **Low Coupling** - The low coupling pattern advocates that objects should be designed in a way that minimizes their interdependence and reduces the risk of unintended consequences if one object is changed.
4. **High Cohesion** - The high cohesion pattern suggests that objects should have a clear and specific responsibility, and all the methods and properties of an object should relate to that responsibility.
5. **Controller** - The controller pattern proposes that there should be an object responsible for coordinating the actions of other objects and enforcing the rules that govern their interactions.
6. **Polymorphism** - The polymorphism pattern suggests that objects should be designed in a way that allows them to be used interchangeably, even if they have different implementations.
7. **Pure Fabrication** - The pure fabrication pattern suggests that developers should create objects solely for the purpose of performing a particular task, even if there is no real-world counterpart for that object.
